# Rails for JavaScript Developers

## Summary

This curriculum assumes you have learned Express and completed the Ruby Language Curriculum. It intentionally excludes the view layer and asset pipeline, as you will learn to use Rails as an API for thick JavaScript clients.

## Note: (update October 9, 2018) 
Be sure to check out the resources in the resources.md file.  The 'Rails for Zombies' is an excellent resource that used to be hosted by CodeSchool, which has since been bought out by Pluralsight.  Pluralsight still has the legacy videos available for viewing, but it requires a 10 day trial membership or a full Pluarlsight membership. It would be advisable to only start it when you know that you will be able to complete the exercises within 10 days or just get a membership. ( it's expensive, so the trial is recommended ) .
