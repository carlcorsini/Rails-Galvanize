# Rails Learning Resources

* [Rails for Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org/) It's as awesome as it sounds. I'd start here.
* [The Intro to Rails Screencast I Wish I Had](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-intro-to-rails-screencast-i-wish-i-had--net-22191) This is only 40 minutes long. Definitely watch this and code along!
* [Official Documentation](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) These docs are some of the best docs ever. They hold your hand for a while.
* [RailsCast](http://railscasts.com/) These are really fantastic screencasts.
* [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) This is one of the best free books around.
